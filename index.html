    <div class="Info"> Hi! I am Oribel, a mom of 3 sweet girls, a wife, a teacher, and an artist at heart! I love all things that pertain to decorating,
        with my heart set on designing cakes, event decorating, and home decor!
        As a passionate teacher, a creative, and a self-taught cake designer, I have a genuine desire to share my knowledge with others who share the same interests as me! I have spent countless hours learning and applying the techniques that have made me a master creator, and I would love to share my projects, tutorials, and tricks of these trades with you! 
        
        As a busy mom, wearing several hats, I know what it's like to feel limited on precious time! Sometimes, finding those little shortcuts that can save you time and money is all you need to carry out that spectacular party idea you had in mind! 
        
        Join me as I take you through my lens of celebrating life, I promise to teach you all that I know! &#128522;</div>
